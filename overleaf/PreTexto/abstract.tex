This work presents a system for analyzing GitLab CI/CD pipelines focusing on anomaly detection and automatic recommendations, while preserving privacy by not accessing either the \texttt{.gitlab-ci.yml} file or source code. Data are collected via the GitLab API (pipelines, jobs, and log snippets), normalized, and analyzed using a hybrid approach: robust statistics (p50--p99, mean, standard deviation, z-score) and unsupervised ML (Isolation Forest, K-Means). The system produces a self-contained HTML dashboard with visualizations, lightweight explanations (XAI), and deep links to pipelines/jobs. Early results on public projects show practical feasibility, compliance with RF03 (ML) and RF04 (automatic recommendations), and measurable potential to reduce runtime and failures.
